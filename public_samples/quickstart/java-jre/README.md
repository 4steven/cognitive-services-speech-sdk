This sample demonstrates how to recognize speech with Java using the Speech SDK for Java.
See the [accompanying article](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/quickstart-java-jre) on the SDK documentation page which describes how to build this sample from scratch in Eclipse.

## Prerequisites

* A subscription key for the Speech service. See [Try the speech service for free](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/get-started).
* A PC (Windows, Linux) capable to run Eclipse, with a working microphone.
* The latest version of [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org).

## Build the sample

> Note: more detailed step-by-step instructions are available [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/quickstart-java-jre).

* **By downloading the Microsoft Cognitive Services Speech SDK when building this sample, you acknowledge its license, see [Speech SDK license agreement](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/license).**
* [Download the sample code to your development PC.](../../README.md#get-the-samples)
* Create an empty workspace in Eclipse and import this folder as a project into your workspace.
* Edit the `Main` source:
  * Replace the string `YourSubscriptionKey` with your own subscription key.
  * Replace the string `YourServiceRegion` with the service region of your subscription.
